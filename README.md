## Eureka Server
This service is used to try registering a service in Eureka server (service registry). 
To run multiple instances of the service we need to run them in separate terminals. 

## GitHub Actions
I configured some workflows in .github/workflows folder. 
I also configured branch protection in GitHub 
so one won't be able to push changes without an approval and without passing all the checks successfully
